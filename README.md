# Form-Validation

Implemented form validation techniques using regular expressions (regex) to ensure that the data entered by users
is in the correct format.
Used regex patterns to validate fields such as phone numbers, email addresses, and dates to ensure that the
information entered is accurate and meets the expected format.
